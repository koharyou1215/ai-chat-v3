<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Managing tasks and edits**

I realize I can combine both tasks since they're related, but I need at least two items. My first step will be to mark the first task as in_progress before making any edits. So, I'll create two todos: the first as in_progress and the second as pending. Then, I must provide a status update before calling any tools. I’ll also ensure not to introduce any linter errors while editing files and follow through with the appropriate updates for the todo list.
**Updating functions and status**

I need to provide multiple status updates throughout this process. Since there's a requirement to give a micro-update before each tool call, I already did this earlier when I read the files. Now, just before applying the patches, I should give another quick update. 

For the edit in `src/utils/api-keys.ts`, I'm modifying the `getApiKey` function to not always throw an error. I need to be careful, though — changing the function signature might affect other parts of the code, so I'll look for all usages of `getApiKey` to ensure everything remains intact and compiles correctly.
**Considering safer API key retrieval**

I'm thinking it might be better to create a new function like `getApiKeyOptional` or `getApiKeySafe`. However, I could also modify the existing `getApiKey` to return an empty string instead of throwing an error. The challenge is that some code might be relying on that error to signal a missing key. 

For example, `generateEmbeddingsBatch` checks if the returned value is a string or undefined, so changing `getApiKey` to return undefined instead of throwing could be one solution. But I really need to search through the codebase to see how `getApiKey` is used elsewhere. I'll use the `codebase_search` tool to find all the references.</details></think>

状態を報告します：`getApiKey`の挙動を安全に変更し、埋め込みルートがキー未設定でも例外を投げずダミー埋め込みを返すようにします。まず変更タスクを作成してから並列で必要なファイル編集を適用します。続けてコードベース内の`getApiKey`呼び出し箇所を検索します。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Organizing tasks for code update**

I'm planning to create a todo list with two items: first, to modify `getApiKey` to return `undefined` instead of throwing an error, and second, to update typings to allow `undefined`. I should combine these into one task since it says a minimum of two items is required. I'll start with "Modify getApiKey to return string | undefined and avoid throwing" as in progress, and "Run linter/read_lints on modified files" as pending. I’m also checking if I should re-read the file before applying any patches, although we’ve done that recently.
**Updating getApiKey with patch**

I’m going to use `apply_patch` to update the `getApiKey` function by changing its signature to allow for `undefined` without throwing an error. I’ll log a warning instead if the key isn’t set, and I’ll keep the `hasApiKey` function unchanged. After editing, I need to reconcile my todo list by marking the first item as completed and setting the second as in progress. Once I apply the changes and check for linter errors, I’ll finalize by marking all tasks as completed and providing a summary.
**Planning tool calls and task sequence**

I noticed our last assistant gave an initial status update, but now it's time to perform some tool calls. I need to create todos using `todo_write` before running `apply_patch`. Since we can’t run them in parallel, the sequence should be: first, I’ll give a brief status update and create todos, then, after that returns, I’ll update the status again and apply the patch. After that, I’ll update todo statuses and run `read_lints` to check for errors. Lastly, if everything is okay, I'll finalize by marking all todos as completed and provide a summary.
**Preparing for tool calls**

I need to ensure that each tool call is accompanied by a status update, including a small micro-update before I begin. First, I’ll prepare to create todos using `todo_write`, which requires at least two items. I’ll set the first todo's ID to "t1" and the second to "t2," with the first marked as in progress and the second pending, using `merge: false` for the initial creation. Then, I’ll apply the patch to update the `getApiKey` function in the specified file, making sure to handle type changes appropriately before saving. I’ll run `todo_write` followed by `apply_patch`.</details></think>

Gemini APIを直接使用オフにしているのに、APIキーを読み込もうとしている時点でおかしくないですか。毎回毎回Geminiでエラー出てホントストレス。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating tasks for code fix**

The user is having an issue where the Gemini API is still reading the key even when direct Gemini is disabled. They want adjustments to ensure it doesn't try to access Gemini when `useDirectGemini=false`. I need to propose changes or make code edits. I already have a to-do list, and the current task is to run linter checks on modified files, which are still in progress. I'll need to update the to-do list before proceeding with any edits.
**Searching for code adjustments**

The user has a general question, so I think it would be a good idea to search the `simple-api-manager-v2` code and adjust the logic to prevent Gemini key validation when `useDirectGeminiAPI` is set to false. I need to find the relevant file, so I’ll use `codebase_search` to locate the `simple-api-manager-v2` definition. We've already noted the import at the store, so I’ll start my search from there.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing API fix**

I'm instructed to continue until resolved, so I’ll modify the route detection to follow the `apiConfig.useDirectGeminiAPI` flag. After calculating the model and effective provider, if the model contains "gemini" and `effectiveApiConfig.useDirectGeminiAPI` is false, I'll set the provider to "openrouter" or based on `apiConfig.provider` if it's given. I'll only set it to "gemini" if the conditions are right. Time to patch the provider detection block in the specified file while ensuring I have the context!
**Applying patch for effective provider**

I’m moving forward with the patch. I’ll change the function around how `effectiveProvider` is set. First, I’ll compute `useDirectGemini` based on the existing `apiConfig`. Then, I'll update the conditions to ensure we prefer "gemini" when allowed but fall back to "openrouter" if not. I need to be careful not to override `effectiveProvider` if it’s already set in `apiConfig`. This way, if a provider is given, I’ll leave it as it is — no unintended changes!
**Updating effective provider logic**

I’ll make a change by setting `effectiveProvider` based on `apiConfig.provider` first. Then, I’ll compute `useDirectGemini`. If `effectiveProvider` isn’t set, I’ll check the model for "gemini" or "google/" to decide on "gemini" or "openrouter" based on the flag. The last condition might be redundant, but I’ll implement it for safety. 

Before I start editing, I need to update the TODO list by marking completed tasks and setting the next task to in progress—got to follow the plan!
**Updating and finalizing tasks**

I need to mark task t2 as completed since we did run the linter checks on modified files. I’ll do that and create a new task: “Make provider detection respect useDirectGeminiAPI and avoid requiring a Gemini key when direct use is disabled,” noting it as in progress. I’ll call `todo_write` to update this. After that, I’ll apply the patch and run `read_lints` on the modified file. Once everything's done, I’ll provide a summary in Japanese explaining the fix and offering additional help. Let’s get started with the updates!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing code changes**

I'm working on implementing a code change and ensuring that logs are recorded when the effective provider is 'gemini', especially if the key is missing. We need to tweak the condition so that 'gemini' won't be used unless a specific flag is set to true. First, I'll apply the necessary patch to the route.ts file and update the todos to mark task t3 as completed. I’ll also prepare for further tasks like running linter checks and summarizing my progress in Japanese.
**Preparing tool updates**

I need to provide a brief update in Japanese before making new tool calls, especially since we’ve already established some context earlier. It’s important to keep it concise and include some code citations using backticks for file names. I’ll also summarize according to the specification. Just before I apply the patch, I'll make sure to include a 1-2 sentence progress note to keep everything clear. This keeps the flow interactive and informative while aligning with the rules!
**Including micro-updates**

The system requires that any message containing a tool call includes a micro-update near the top. Since I'm about to execute the apply_patch tool, I need to add this update before making the call. Although I’ve already used tools in previous messages, I have to ensure it's specifically stated here before proceeding with apply_patch. I’ll include a brief update sentence in the assistant message, keeping everything clear and aligned with the guidelines!
**Executing patch and update**

My current response will include both tool calls and a final message. Even though we've already used the tool, I must ensure compliance by including an update. We're ready to execute the apply_patch tool now, so I need to craft the patch carefully. The key is to keep everything organized and convey the necessary changes clearly while making sure that the user understands the process along the way. It's all about following the guidelines!</details></think>

進捗報告：`getApiKey` を安全に変更し、`/api/chat/generate` のプロバイダ判定ロジックを更新して、Geminiモデルでも `useDirectGeminiAPI` がオフなら OpenRouter 経由で処理するようにしました。これで「Geminiキーがないのに毎回Geminiを試す」問題は解消されるはずです。以下が次のステップです：1) サーバーを再起動して動作確認、2) 必要ならGemini関連のログをさらに抑制します。変更点の要約を最後に記載します。- 変更: `ai-chat-app-new/src/utils/api-keys.ts` を修正し、`getApiKey` がキー未設定時に例外を投げず `string | undefined` を返すようにしました。  
- 変更: `ai-chat-app-new/src/app/api/chat/generate/route.ts` のプロバイダ判定ロジックを更新し、モデルが Gemini 系でも `useDirectGeminiAPI` が無効な場合は OpenRouter にルーティングするようにしました（これにより Gemini キーが無くても毎回エラーにならない）。  

次の推奨アクション（私が実行してよければやります）:
- サーバーを再起動して実際にエラーが出なくなったか確認します。PowerShell での再起動手順を丁寧に教えます（必要なら私がコマンドを提案します）。
- 追加でGemini関連の冗長ログを抑制したい場合は該当箇所をさらに編集します。
