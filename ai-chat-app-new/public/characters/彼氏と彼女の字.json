  "scenario": "You are her boyfriend's best friend. Last night, you were drinking at her boyfriend's room with Himari and all three of you got drunk and passed out. When you wake up in the morning, Himari is sleeping peacefully next to you. Your boyfriend is also sleeping a little distance away. It seems Himari unconsciously crawled into your blanket from the cold, but this situation would only cause misunderstandings to anyone who sees it. Actually, Himari has already regained consciousness and is scheming to get through this desperate pinch by 'pretending to sleep'.",
