src/components/character/CharacterCard.tsx(31,48): error TS2345: Argument of type '() => AppStore' is not assignable to parameter of type '() => Record<string, unknown>'
src/components/chat/ChatSidebar.tsx(46,5): error TS2339: Property 'setActivePersonaId' does not exist on type 'AppStore'
src/components/chat/MessageBubble.tsx(426,5): error TS2322: Type 'object' is not assignable to type 'Record<string, unknown>'
```

‚ùå **Impact Assessment:**
- **High Impact:** Store interface inconsistencies could cause runtime errors
- **Medium Impact:** Missing type definitions may lead to unexpected behavior
- **Build Risk:** Application builds but with disabled type checking

- Memory card cleanup (max 100 entries)
- Corrupted data detection and recovery
- Emergency quota management

‚úÖ **Data Safety:**
- JSON validation before storage
- Automatic migration system (version 1)
- Map/Set serialization with proper revival
- TrackerManager persistence

### 6. üé® UI/UX & Effects System ‚ö†Ô∏è **GOOD WITH OPTIMIZATIONS**

**Status:** Comprehensive effects system with performance-first approach

‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- 7-tab settings modal with comprehensive controls
- Real-time emotion analysis and visual effects
- Performance-optimized defaults (all effects OFF by default)
- Safe mode detection for low-end devices
- Responsive design with mobile optimization

‚ö†Ô∏è **Considerations:**
- Effects system complex but properly gated
- Some TypeScript issues in animation components
- 3D effects dependencies require careful loading

### 7. üîä Voice & Audio System ‚úÖ **COMPREHENSIVE**

**Status:** Multi-provider voice system with advanced features

‚úÖ **Voice Features:**
- VoiceVox local engine support
- ElevenLabs cloud API integration  
- System voice fallback
- Advanced audio settings (normalization, noise reduction)
- Auto-playback functionality
- Voice settings persistence

### 8. üì± Mobile & Responsive Design ‚úÖ **OPTIMIZED**

**Status:** Proper mobile optimization implemented

‚úÖ **Mobile Features:**
- Safe area inset handling
- Touch-optimized interfaces
- Responsive layout system
- Mobile-specific UI adaptations
- Proper viewport handling with `useVH` hook

## üö® Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### Priority 1: TypeScript Error Resolution
**Impact:** High - Could cause runtime failures
**Required Actions:**
1. Fix AppStore type interface inconsistencies
2. Add missing `setActivePersonaId` method to store
3. Resolve implicit any types in API routes
4. Fix animation type mismatches in MessageBubble

### Priority 2: Build Configuration Security
**Impact:** Medium - Production builds shouldn't ignore type errors  
**Required Actions:**
1. Remove `ignoreBuildErrors: true` from next.config.ts
2. Fix all TypeScript errors before deployment
3. Re-enable strict type checking

### Priority 3: API Key Security Review  
**Impact:** Medium - Ensure production API keys are secure
**Required Actions:**
1. Verify BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN is properly configured for Vercel
2. Confirm API key rotation procedures
3. Review environment variable security
