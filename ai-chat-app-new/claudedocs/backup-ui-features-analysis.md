2. **Visual Appeal**: Professional-grade theming system
3. **Accessibility**: Better font and contrast controls
4. **Storage Management**: Proactive storage optimization

## Next Steps

1. Extract AppearancePanel from backup
2. Extract ColorSetting component
3. Verify AppearanceSettings types compatibility
4. Implement theme preset system
5. Test theme switching functionality
